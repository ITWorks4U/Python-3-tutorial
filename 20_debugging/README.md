#	No debugging is required

> Where do you come from? :o)

Debugging is the most spent time of programming. It helps you to understand, find and fix the tiniest logical error, which causes the huge problem.

##	How to debug

usually, by using any IDE a debugger is implemented automatically => just set a breakpoint, run your code with F5 and you're early or later on your breakpoint
Python also comes with a debugger module, which can easy be used, too.
