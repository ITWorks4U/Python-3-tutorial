##	The purpose of functions

-	write a code once only and let it execute again and again and again
-	for a better maintenance and code overview

###	attention

-	before a function is able to call, it __MUST__ be defined before
-	a function may have arguments, which are required to call the function; in that case it's required to call this function with the correct amount of arguments
-	since in Python no data types exists, you can use ANY kind of arguments, which causes an undefined behavior on runtime
-	a function may have a return value => in Python you can also return an another type in contrast to the forced expectation
-	in Python you're also welcome to return different types at the same time
