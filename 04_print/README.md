"just" use print() function

##	What can be printed?

everything you want (and don't want to see, if you don't mind)

##	Can I format my output?

Of course you can. Ther'e different ways to do this:
- use the C-like syntax (see: printing formatters 1)
- use the Java / C#-like syntax (see: printing formatters 2)
- use the Python-syntax (see: printing formatters 3)
