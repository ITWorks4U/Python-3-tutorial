#	Purpose

-	regular expressions helps you very often to check, if a certain word <=> expression is valid or not
-	often used for numeric expectations => usually, these can also be handled with an exception handling procedure (see: #18), but it's also possible to do this much easier

##	Are regular expressions hard to use?

Yes, but actually, no.
When you know how to use them, then these are helping you to handle situations much more easier for you.
