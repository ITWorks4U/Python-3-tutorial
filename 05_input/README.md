#	Reading from console

"just" use input() function

##	Can I format my input?

-	yes, but it's a bit complicated
-	you can use a promt text as an argument for the input function to tell the user what to do here
-	depending on the python version or by using other packages you might also do some other stuff, which is not in use here

###	attention
-	EVERYTING will be "a word" when it's read from the keyboard or from a file
-	to format your given sub word into a correct type make sure, that this is possible => take a look for regular expressions (#25)
